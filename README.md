### Demo chat

### How it works
* SQLite database is managing the users
* Each one can link it's member to the wallet address, by ```/link GUD...``` command
* Only who has the **Sponsor** role can use custodian wallet to tip the members by command: ```/tip <amount> <user>```. Or by reacting the message with bears:
- üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è - 100 BEARS
- üêª - 10 BEARS
- üêº - 5 BEARS
- üß∏ - 1 BEAR

* If target member does not have the linked Stellar account - notification message will be sent to target and source(DM) accounts.
* If target member has the Stellar account but not the trustline - Claimable balance will be created with clawback timeout.
